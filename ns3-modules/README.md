# New Modules

Drag and drop the module in to ns3/contrib, then run and build normally


# Seeing Examples of New Modules

For now, there is only one (AirSimConnect), but there will be examples in "NewModuleName'/examples/NewModulesName-Example.cc
Drag and drop the example.cc file to where you usually run NS3 script. I just put it in psc-ns3/scratch.
Then you can run it to see a basic functionality. Comments will be in the example.cc to help explain the functions need and used
